## Sample Blog with API-based CMS and handlebars as template engine

This is a fork of the current Prismic Blog example but using `Handlebars` instead and `Pug`

Original : https://github.com/prismicio/nodejs-blog/

Node.js blog is a blog template with content managed in prismic.io (an API-based CMS).

#### Getting started

Read [this guide](https://intercom.help/prismicio/examples/nodejs-samples/sample-blog-with-api-based-cms-in-nodejs) for instructions to create your repository and use the sample blog.
